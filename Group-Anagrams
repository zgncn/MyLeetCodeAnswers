Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
Example 2:

Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]


SOLUTION

from collections import defaultdict

def groupAnagrams(strs):
    result = defaultdict(list)
    for s in strs:
        key = "".join(sorted(list(s)))
        result[key].append(s)

    output = []
    for i in result.values():
        output.append(i)

    return output


print(groupAnagrams(["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]))

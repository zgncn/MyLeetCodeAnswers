Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false


SOLUTION

def isIsomorphic(s,t):
    map1={}
    map2={}
    for c1,c2 in zip(s,t):
        if((c1 in map1 and map1[c1]!=c2) or
            (c2 in map2 and map2[c2]!=c1)):
            return False

        map1[c1]=c2
        map2[c2]=c1

    return True

s="egh"
t="foo" 
print(isIsomorphic(s,t))
